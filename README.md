This Google Ads script automates budget management by incrementally increasing the daily budget for selected campaigns over time. It ensures the budget is gradually adjusted every 4 days by 15%, helping to scale ad spend without triggering a new learning phase for the campaign. Additionally, the script allows users to set a maximum target budget for each campaign, ensuring the budget doesnâ€™t exceed the desired limit.

The script also tracks each budget increase using Google Sheets for logging, and labels campaigns with the date of the last budget increase.
